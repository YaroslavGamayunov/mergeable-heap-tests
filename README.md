# Mergeable Heaps Tests
In this project you can find implementation and test tools of three types of heap datastructure: **binomial heap**, **leftist heap** and **skew heap**

# Heaps
## Binomial heap
This heap is a list of trees with unique orders. You can find more infromation on [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap "Binomial Heap")
## Leftist and Skew heaps 
These heaps are almost similar because [skew heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_heap "Skew Heap") is a self-adjusting form of [leftist heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist_tree "Leftist Heap")
